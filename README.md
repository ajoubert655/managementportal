## Invigulus Management Portal

This web application created with React.js allows clients and employees of the company to view, add, edit, and delete records in the companyâ€™s database (AWS DynamoDB). Rest APIs were written to facilitate the API calls. 

This project was completed in collaboration with @MichaelGrier who completed the home page, the view tables (organization, test, user, sessions), authentication, applied the API calls on the test forms and most of the view tables, and completed the general structure of the API calls that we would use throughout the app. I completed the forms functionality (organization, test, login), the alert, and applied the API calls on the organization view table as well as the organization forms.

## This code is being shared with the permission of Invigulus, but login access to web app functionality is only available to Invigulus staff.
